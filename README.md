#This Project was oriented on using many different Javascript 
On this project I learned about many javascript method and how the implement them on my project to get great results in this case creating this snake game which made use of many method some of them like 

- .push() //Leting you add one or more elements into the end of an array 
- .classList //add,remove and contain. They're strong and useful methods to modify the styles from the Html using JS.
- .addEventListener() // this method in particular it's really usefull to add many extra functionalities into the HTML with JS to do many things, in this case, to listen to click in buttons 
- .keyCode also is a useful one and in this case I did use it a lot to listen to my keyboard and make the snake move around.
